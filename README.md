# Team: test bot please ignore
Battlecode bot for MIT Battlecode 2017. Team consisted of Stuart Johnson and Milo Hartsoe. Battlecode is MIT's longest running programming competition. It features a unique challenge that combines battle strategy, software engineering and artificial intelligence. In short, the objective is to write the best AI player program for the strategy game Battlecode. Anyone can participate, as long as you know how to program.

Battlecode is a real-time strategy game. Two teams of virtual robots roam the screen managing resources and attacking each other with different weapons. Your job is to write code to strategically manage your robot army and control how your robots work together to defeat the enemy team. Contestants learn to use artificial intelligence, pathfinding, distributed algorithms, and/or network communications to write their player.

Teams are given the Battlecode software and a specification of the game rules in early January. The competition lasts throughout the month and culminates in a Final Tournament. During these tournaments, the autonomous players are pitted against each other in a dramatic head-to-head fashion. The final rounds of the main tournament are played out in front of a live audience in Kresge auditorium, MIT, with the top teams receiving cash prizes. The total prize pool each year is over $50,000.

We ranked 36 in the league running up to the qualifying tournament, and made it to the top 32 teams there. We were one win away from making top 16, which would have qualified us for a paid trip to MIT to join the finals in full.  

Matches were decided in a best of three on maps unseen up until the competition. Format was double elimination bracket to ensure the sixteen best teams made it to the finals.
